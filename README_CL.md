# Wu11-VTC

This code collection reproduces part of the images and Table 2 in the paper "A Tight Lower Bound on the Gaussian Q -Function With a Simple Inversion Algorithm, and an Application to Coherent Optical Communications‚Äù. Detailed information about the paper is on the website "https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8353222".  



Figure 1, Figure 2, and Figure 4 are the same as the original in the paper. The value of x_f in Table 2 is somewhat inconsistent with the original text, perhaps because it has something to do with which iteration value was selected in the end. I don't think my understanding is wrong. Figure 3 is a schematic diagram and has no specific meaning; I did not make a drawing. I had trouble drawing Figure 5 and only drew part of it. Above all, if you have any ideas, you are welcome to discuss them.



Those codes were completed in March June 2021 and June 2023 by Maximal-K.
